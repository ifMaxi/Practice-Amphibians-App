# Practice - AmphibiansApp

An app to put into practice the topics learned in unit 5 of the "Android basics with compose" course.

The idea was to create an app that shows a list of Amphibinas through network requirements.

Technologies used:

- Jetpack Compose
- Retrofit, to connect with the Api web server.
- Kotlin Coutines for asynchronous code
- Kotlin: Serialization
- Coil, to load images from the internet
- JSON, to return structured data that the app needs
